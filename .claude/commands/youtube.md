Use the youtube-analyzer skill to analyze the YouTube video URL provided by the user.

If the user provided a URL, use it. Otherwise, ask them for a YouTube URL.

Follow the youtube-analyzer skill workflow:
1. Get video information first
2. Present it clearly to the user
3. Ask what they'd like to do next (download video, audio, transcript, etc.)
4. Execute their choice

Be helpful and guide them through the options available.
